    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
    <p>
    IT in the D is a nonprofit collaboration of technology leaders in Detroit that provides continued education 
    and work experience for IT professionals as they advance their technology careers.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>IT in the D is a non-profit program that provides students with valuable real-world work experience, 
    training and job opportunities, as they launch their technology careers in Detroit. 
    </li>
    <p>
    Started by five downtown Detroit companies, each on a mission to determine why they were having trouble 
    finding qualified candidates for their many job openings, IT in the D is a collaborative effort that 
    aims to identify and fill the gaps between the local talent pool and current hiring needs. 
    </p> 
    <h4>Program</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>
        IT in the D is a 10 week experiential learning program that consists of 40 students and 15 trainers, 
        depending on project. The students and trainers are divided amongst two teams, with one focusing on open 
        source technologies and the other focusing on proprietary technologies. Students will be placed on teams 
        dependent upon the skill set/focus area they are most interested in pursuing. In addition to the 
        technologies, the program also offers trainers specializing in business analysis and project management.
        </li>
        <p> 
        Throughout the program, students will be advised how to articulate what they are learning, so to be able 
        to market themselves properly to potential employers. Towards the end of the program, a resume and 
        interview training session as well as mock interviews will be conducted by the recruiting teams of all 
        companies, the Workforce Intelligence Network and other local career organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
        Students are required to commit to the full ten weeks, meeting twice a week for two hours at the offices 
        of the downtown Detroit companies.
        <p>
        At the end of the program, there will be a closing ceremony where students can bring their friends and 
        family to show off all of their hard work. Certificates will be presented and students will be made 
        aware of all resources available to them, having completed the program.
        </p>
        </ul>
