            <div>
                Quicken Loans is one of the largest full-service residential mortgage lenders in
                the United States. We're America's #1 Online Mortgage Lender. We close loans in
                all 50 states and have more than 20 years of experience in the industry.
                <p>
                    It all started in June of 1985 with a simple concept that, even today, large mortgage
                    companies just don't get. Guess what? Buying a house can be one of the most stressful,
                    frightening, exhilarating, and exciting times in a person's life. Dan Gilbert, our
                    Founder and Chairman, thought to himself, WE CAN DO IT BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we did.
